 * `led`: LED board control on port 8080 through a browser using WebSockets
 * `motor`: Motor control on port 8080 through a browser using WebSockets

The moter example uses an abstraction layer, and will run on most GNU/Linux
systems. The emulation layer will output the RPI GPIO commands to the console.
